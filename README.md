# Manufacturing-services-month-end-close
Two-month month-end close and financial reporting simulation for a manufacturing and professional services company under U.S. GAAP.
# Month-End Close & Financial Reporting  
### Manufacturing + Professional Services Company (February–March 2025)

## Project Overview
This project simulates a two-month month-end close for a U.S.-based manufacturing company that also provides professional installation and maintenance services. The objective is to mirror real-world corporate accounting and audit workflows under U.S. GAAP, including transaction processing, adjusting entries, reconciliations, and financial reporting.

The project was built alongside CPA exam preparation to strengthen practical application of accrual accounting, revenue recognition, inventory accounting, and internal controls.
